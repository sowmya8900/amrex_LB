<!-- # Exploring Dynamic Load Balancing Algorithms for Block-Structured Mesh-and-Particle Simulations in AMReX -->



## **Steps to run the Jupyter Notebooks**

  
## **Getting Started**

Follow these instruction, once you have generated the output from the optimized algorithms. This instruction involves running the jupyter-notebooks to generate the analysis and figures using the obtained results from the three different cases. 

### **Installation**

1. For running the python files and notebooks create a conda environemnt using this file.
   ```
   conda env create -f requirements.yaml

   ```
2. Install ipykernel

   ```
   conda install -c anaconda ipykernel
   ```

3. Add the conda environment to the jupyter notebook

   ```
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=load_balancing

   ```


### **Run Instructions**

1.  To run the jupyter-notebook change the ```kernel``` in jupyter to ```load_balancing```
